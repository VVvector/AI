# {{Project Name}} Design Document

## Introduction
This document outlines the overall project architecture for {{Project Name}}, serving as the architectural blueprint for development.

### Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |

## High Level Architecture
### Technical Summary
Provide a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) overview of:
- The system’s overall architecture style
- Key components and their relationships
- Primary technology choices
- Core architectural patterns being used
- Reference back to the PRD goals and how this architecture supports them

### High Level Overview
1. The main architectural style
2. Primary user interaction flow or data flow at a conceptual level
3. Key architectural decisions and their rationale

### High Level Project Diagram
Create a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the high-level architecture. Consider:
- System boundaries
- Major components
- Data flow directions
Use appropriate Mermaid diagram type (graph TD, C4, sequence) based on what best represents the architecture

### Architectural and Design Patterns
- **{{pattern_name}}:** {{pattern_description}} - _Rationale:_ {{rationale}}

## Tech Stack
### Technology Stack Table
| Category       | Technology   | Version | Purpose          | Rationale      |
| :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :--------------- | :------------- |
| **Language**   | Python       | 3.9.x     | Core development | Versatility    |
| **Testing**    | pytest       | x.x     | Test execution   | Python standard|
| **Logging**    | logging      | -       | System monitoring| Standard library|

## Data Models
### {{model_name}}
**Purpose:** {{model_purpose}}  
**Key Attributes:**  
- {{attribute}}: {{type}} - {{description}}

## Components
Based on the architectural patterns, tech stack, and data models from above:
1. Identify major logical components/services and their responsibilities
2. Define clear boundaries and interfaces between components
3. For each component, specify:
   - Primary responsibility
   - Key interfaces/APIs exposed
   - Dependencies on other components
   - Technology specifics based on tech stack choices
4. Create component diagrams where helpful

### {{component_name}}
**Responsibility:** {{component_description}}  
**Key Interfaces:** {{interface}}  
**Dependencies:** {{dependencies}}  
**Technology:** {{component_tech_details}}

### Component Diagrams
Create Mermaid diagrams to visualize component relationships. Options:
- C4 Container diagram for high-level view
- Component diagram for detailed internal structure
- Sequence diagrams for complex interactions
- Choose the most appropriate for clarity

## Error Handling Strategy
Define comprehensive error handling approach:
- Choose appropriate patterns for the language/framework from Tech Stack
- Define logging standards and tools
- Establish error categories and handling rules
- Consider observability and debugging needs
- Ensure security (no sensitive data in logs)

### General Approach
- **Error Model:** {{error_model}}
- **Logging:** Standard logging module with structured format
- **User-Facing Errors:** Clear error messages with error codes

## Coding Standards
### Core Standards
- **Python Version:** 3.9.x
- **Linter:** ruff
- **Docstrings:** Google-style for all public methods
- **Typing:** Type hints for all public interfaces

## Test Strategy and Standards
### Testing Philosophy
- **Approach**: Test-driven development (TDD)
- **Coverage Goal:** 90%+ for core modules
- **Test Pyramid:** 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e

### Unit Tests
- **Framework:** pytest
- **Location:** tests/unit/
- **Requirements:** 
  - Generate tests for all public methods
  - Cover edge cases and error conditions
  - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
  - Mock all external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- **Scope:** Component interactions
- **Location:** tests/integration/
- **Data:** Temporary test fixtures
